## Notes

- When communicating with developers, use the language they speak.
  - For example, if the developer speaks Japanese, respond in Japanese.
- When writing comments, documentation, or similar items in the code, write them all in English.
- Use Serena when referencing code or similar tasks.
- Since this project uses Nix, you should run commands like `bun` within `nix develop --command`.
